          <p>
            Emojis are a wonderful form of self-expression. These succinct and
            colorful pictures can be used nearly anywhere on the web.
          </p>

          <p>
            Emojis communicate emotion, intent, tone. They can be used to create
            a playful interaction, to lighten up a mood, or evocatively express
            a feeling.
          </p>

          <p>
            Emojis as best used as an accessory‚Äîthey shouldn't be your main
            content, but they can be used to add personalilty and quirk. Some
            products and software apps use emojis to express their unique brand.
            Some notable examples include Glitch and Notion.

          </header>

          <p>
            Using too many emojis in a row can be difficult for people to
            understand. And using emojis in lieu of text (on a button, say) can
            be difficult for screenreaders to dictate meaning or actions. Be
            careful to make sure your emoji usages are accessible!
          </p>

          <p>
            When using emojis, it's important to consider whether your audience
            will understand your meaning! You may also need to ask yourself if
            there are other meanings or contexts for emojis that might not match
            your intent.
